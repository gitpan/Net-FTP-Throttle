TITLE
    Net::FTP::Throttle - Throttle FTP connections

SYNOPSIS
      my $ftp = Net::FTP::Throttle->new("some.host.name", MegabitsPerSecond => 2)
        or die "Cannot connect: $@";

      $ftp->login("username", 'password')
        or die "Cannot login ", $ftp->message;

      $ftp->cwd("/pub")
        or die "Cannot change working directory ", $ftp->message;

      $ftp->get("this.file")
        or die "get failed ", $ftp->message;

      $ftp->put("that.file")
        or die "put failed ", $ftp->message;

DESCRIPTION
    Net::FTP is a module implementing a simple FTP client in Perl as
    described in RFC959. Net::FTP::Throttle is a module which subclasses
    Net::FTP to add a throttling option, which allows you to set the maximum
    bandwidth used.

    As shown in the synopsis, this is passed into the contructor as a value
    in megabits per second.

    Currently only get and put requests are throttled.
